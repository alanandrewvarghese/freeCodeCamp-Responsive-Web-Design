# Responsive Web Design Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects I built while completing the Responsive Web Design certification from freeCodeCamp. Each project demonstrates key concepts of responsive design, including flexible layouts, media queries, and accessible web development practices. The projects areresponsive and adhere to modern web standards, ensuring they work well across a range of devices and screen sizes.

2. **Survey Form** - A responsive and accessible survey form.
3. **Product Landing Page** - A landing page designed for a fictional product or service.
4. **Technical Documentation Page** - A technical documentation page, demonstrating multi-section layout and navigation.
